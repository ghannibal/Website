                The Excellence in Digital Sciences and Interdisciplinary Technologies (EXDIGIT) project pursues the
                long-term vision of establishing Salzburg as a leading and internationally recognized hub for digital
                sciences and interdisciplinary technologies. EXDIGIT aims to serve as an innovative platform that
                combines technological excellence with
                social relevance. Its stated objective is to develop and apply digital key technologies such as
                Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Geoinformatics or Human-Computer Interaction not in isolation, but in
                dynamic interaction with ethical, social, ecological, and economic perspectives, and to embed them into
                broader disciplinary contexts.

                PIs: Sabine Koeszegi and Markus Vincze<br>

                The interdisciplinary Doctoral College (DC) on “Trust in Robots – Trusting Robots” aims to foster
                cutting-edge research in robotics and AI at the TU Wien. The main objective of the DC is to
                comprehensively analyse “trust” in the context of robot technology from various perspectives including
                but not limited to social sciences and economics, computer science and mathematics, electrical and
                mechanical engineering, and architecture.
                The fundamental question concerns how people can develop an appropriately trusting relationship with
                autonomous machines. When is trust in an autonomous system appropriate? When should we trust a care
                robot to make the right decisions? When would it be wise not to trust? And even if we initially trusted
                a robot, which experiences would and should change our trust in it?

                <br>
                PI: Astrid Weiss<br>
                Funding: FWF (Elise Richter programme)<br>
                Budget: 250.000 EUR<br>
                Duration: 2018-2022<br>
                <br>
                The working hypothesis of this project is that the interaction of ordinary users with a social companion
                robot (in this project the commercially available robot Anki Vector) changes over time and that its
                adoption and acceptance differ in terms of the socio-demographic qualities of the involved households.
                The main goal is to gain detailed empirical evidence on the adoption and acceptance processes from a
                relatively small sample (eight households) over a longer period of time (eight months), therefore an
                ethnographic approach is chosen as methodology. Several household visits accompanied by specific field
                tools and techniques (semi-structured qualitative interviews, Day Reconstruction Method,
                drawing/tinkering activities, short questionnaires/rating scales) will be performed. A baseline of
                existing household routines will be established in a pre-visit before households receive an Anki Vector
                and are firstly regularly visited over a period of six months. After half a year, the absence of Anki
                Vector and its impact on the social household dynamics will be studied by giving it back for one month,
                after a one-month break.
