        <p>I have the pleasure of leading and being involved in several exciting research projects.</p>
        <h3>Suspicious of Artificial Intelligence (SUSAI) </h3>
        <mark>#Principle Investigator</mark>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Extensive theoretical and empirical work has enabled the human-AI interaction (HAII) research community to
            understand what makes people trust in AI. In current research, trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
            strongly encouraged because the benefits of trusting are often overemphasized.
            This bias of optimism comes at the expense of a more balanced and
            complete perspective on the nature and the eﬀects of trust because it is
            also important to consider the so-called “dark side”
            . Much less effort is
            devoted to developing a good understanding of mistrust and distrust
            although research has already shown that AI is also used for harmful and
            criminal activities. The topic of mistrust and distrust in AI is sparsely
            explored in the specific context of HAII. The proposed Suspicious of
            Artificial Intelligence (SUSAI) project aims to fill this research gap by
            investigating why people are unwilling to trust in AI by focusing on the
            broader notion of mistrust. Using the methods of a literature review and
            expert interviews, the SUSAI project intends to develop a conceptual
            model of mistrust in AI applicable to everyday life HAII contexts.

        <h3>Understanding and Impacting Consumer Behavior Towards Food Sustainability (Nudge2Green)</h3>
        <mark>#External Collaborater</mark>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Human behavior plays a pivotal role in food sustainability across the supply chain. Nudge2Green seeks to use
            behavior and food sciences, data-driven approaches, and advanced analytics to influence consumer behavior
            and promote sustainable food choices while reducing unhealthy preferences. The project will create a
            framework tested in two use cases: UC1, examining consumer behavior in physical markets, and UC2, exploring
            human factors in e-commerce. With a consortium of universities and companies, the project aims to deliver
            reusable software for organizations and advance knowledge in sustainable food and adaptive systems.

        <p>
            The EXDIGIT project pursues the
            long-term vision of establishing Salzburg as a leading and internationally recognized hub for digital
            sciences and interdisciplinary technologies. EXDIGIT aims to serve as an innovative platform that
            combines technological excellence with
            social relevance. Its stated objective is to develop and apply digital key technologies such as
            Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Geoinformatics or Human-Computer Interaction not in isolation, but in
            dynamic interaction with ethical, social, ecological, and economic perspectives, and to embed them into
            broader disciplinary contexts.

        <h3>Exploring Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction (SharedSpace)</h3>
        <!--<img style="width: 10rem;" src="Anki.jpg">-->
        <mark>#Co-Investigator</mark>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            The SharedSpace project aimed to study the interaction of ordinary users with the social companion
            robot, Anki Vector, over time and how it effected adoption
            and acceptance differ in terms of the socio-demographic qualities of the involved households.
