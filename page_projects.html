        <h3>Understanding and impacting consumer behavior towards food sustainability (Nudge2Green)</h3>
        <p>
            Human behavior plays a pivotal role in food sustainability across the supply chain. Nudge2Green seeks to use
            behavior and food sciences, data-driven approaches, and advanced analytics to influence consumer behavior
            and promote sustainable food choices while reducing unhealthy preferences. The project will create a
            framework tested in two use cases: UC1, examining consumer behavior in physical markets, and UC2, exploring
            human factors in e-commerce. With a consortium of universities and companies, the project aims to deliver
            reusable software for organizations and advance knowledge in sustainable food and adaptive systems.
