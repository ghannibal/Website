        <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently an independent Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://exdigit.plus.ac.at/en/"
                target="_blank">EXDIGIT project</a> in the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces at
            University of Salzburg (since 2024). <!--I am also the Principle Investigator of the SUSAI project (2026-2027)
            fundded by the Early Career Grant, University of Salzburg.-->
            <br><br>
            I was previously a
            Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of
            Artificial Intelligence at Ulm University (2022-2023) where I worked on combining my trust research
            with the topic of Explainable AI (XAI).
            <!--I have also been working as a predoc in the
            <a href="https://igw.tuwien.ac.at" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
                group</a> at TU Wien
            (2018-2022) and in the <a href="https://www.soz.univie.ac.at/en/" target="_blank">Department of
                Sociology</a> at Unviersity of Vienna (2015-2017).

            Part of the TrustRobots Doctoral College (2018-2022) and the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
            group at TU Wien, I obtained my Doctorate in Computer
            Science (2022) where I focused on the topic of Interpersonal Trust in Human-Robot
            Interaction. You are welcome to read and dowload my <a

                target="_blank">dissertation</a>, which I passed with distinction. I
            hold a BA and MA in Philosophy (2015) from
            Aarhus University where my thesis projects explored and presented the metaphysical dimenssions
            of social
            robotics and also considered metaphilosophical perspectives.
            <br>
            <br>
            I contribute actively to the international HCI research
            community, taking on a range of professional
            responsibilities. Notably, I am the Vice Chair of the <a href="https://sigchiaustria.hosting.acm.org"
                target="_blank">Austrian ACM SIGCHI
                Chapter</a>, which is a national research network dedicated to strengthening and coordinating HCI
            research
            within
            Austria. Furthermore, I am growing into a leadership role by taking on supervision responsibilities and
            supporting
            junior researchers in their development. Addition, I regularly serve as program committee member, associate
            chair, and reviewer for
            major conferences and journals. Through these activities, I help
            maintain quality standards, support colleagues, and contribute to shaping discussions in human-AI
            interaction research.

            Her research centers on Human-AI Interaction (HAII) across various domains of application and with a focus
            on trust and explanations. She also works on expanding methodological reflexivity by stressing the
            importance of integrating insights from the humanities and social sciences in the development and evaluation
            of AI.
