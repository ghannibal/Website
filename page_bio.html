        <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently an independent Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://exdigit.plus.ac.at/en/"
                target="_blank">EXDIGIT project</a> in the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces at
            University of Salzburg (2024-2028). I was previously a
            postdoc in the <a href="https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/institute-of-artificial-intelligence/"
                target="_blank">Department of
                Artificial Intelligence</a> at Ulm University (2022-2023). I have also been working as a predoc in the
            <a href="https://igw.tuwien.ac.at" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
                group</a> at TU Wien
            (2018-2022) and in the <a href="https://www.soz.univie.ac.at/en/" target="_blank">Department of
                Sociology</a> at Unviersity of Vienna (2015-2017).
            <br>
            <br>
            I obtained my Doctorate in Computer
            Science from TU Wien (2022, with honors) on the topic of interpersonal trust in Human-Robot Interaction. I
            hold a BA and MA in (analytic) Philosophy from
            Aarhus University (2015) where both my thesis projects explored and presented the metaphysical dimenssions
            of social
            robotics.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to my research and teaching experience, I contribute actively to the international HCI research
            community, taking on a range of professional
            responsibilities. Notably, I have served as an Associate Chair for the subcommittee on Critical Computing,
            Sustainability, and
            Social Justice at the CHI conference in 2025 and 2026. I am also the Vice Chair of the Austrian ACM SIGCHI
            Chapter, which is a national research network dedicated to strengthening and coordinating HCI research
            within
            Austria.

            Her research centers on Human-AI Interaction (HAII) across various domains of application and with a focus
            on trust and explanations. She also works on expanding methodological reflexivity by stressing the
            importance of integrating insights from the humanities and social sciences in the development and evaluation
            of AI.
