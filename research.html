        <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
        <p>
            My research belongs to the interdisciplinary field of <c>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</c>
            where I have a strong interest in understanding and studying how people experience and interact with AI
            in everyday life contexts. Within the HCI research community I have positioned myself as a
            <c>theory-driven researcher working on Human-AI Interaction</c> across various domains of application (e.g.,
            social
            robots, recommender systems, robot process automation, agentic AI, autonomous vehicles) with a special focus
            on the <c>relationship between (interpersonal) trust and explanations</c>.
            To extend my expertise and to
            pursue a habilitation in HCI
            at University of Salzburg, I am currently working towards a <c>comprehensive and systematic analysis
                of mistrust and distrust in AI</c>. Understanding and studying the so-called “dark side of
            trust” in the specific context of HAII is important for tackling the black-box problem of complex AI
            systems, and I wish to fill
            this research gap by <c>investigating why people are unwilling to trust in AI</c>. My research more
            generally
            covers the three major topics below, and with these short descriptions, I explain
            how my research
            interests and approaches are related.

        <h3>Conceptual Analysis, Modelling, and Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            My research focuses on clarifying and advancing <c>complex social and ethical concepts</c> in human-AI
            interaction
            such as trust, agency,
            explainability, and vulnerability. I combine these theoretical perspectives
            with system development to ensure that concepts are not only clearly defined in theory but can
            also be <c>meaningfully implemented in practice</c>. By connecting conceptual work with challenges in
            science and
            engineering, I help create
            a stronger foundation for theory-driven human-AI interaction research and support the development of
            AI systems
            that are
            socially aware and ethically grounded.
        </p>
        <h3>Online User Research Studies</h3>
        <p>
            I am particularly interested in developing and refining user research methods used to study human-AI
            interaction in online settings. I design and implement <c>interactive experimental setups</c> that
            make use of
            digital
            platforms to conduct research in ways that are scalable, diverse, and closer to
            real-world contexts. By
            expanding the methodological possibilities of online experimentation, I contribute to <c>more robust,
                reproducible, ecologically valid, and innovative research practices </c>. As such, my work enables
            deeper
            insights into
            user
            behavior and supports the development of AI systems that respond more effectively to social contexts and
            human
            needs or preferences.
        </p>
        <h3>Methodological and Metaphilosophical Perspectives</h3>
        <p>
            I work across disciplinary boundaries to
            address
            foundamental questions in human-AI interaction and Computer Science more broadly. I am interested in how
            different <c>disciplines and
                methodologies frame and
                define core problems in AI</c>. By applying philosophical methods such as critical reflection and
            careful
            analysis of
            underlying assumptions, I question and constructively inform mainstream approaches to AI. My
            meta-level perspective allows me to
            also <c>reflect on the epistemological foundations of philosophy</c>. In doing so,
            I
            strengthen the methodological basis of interdiciplinary work and underscores the essential role of
            the humanities and social sciences in addressing complex and unresolved challenges in AI research.
