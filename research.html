        <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
        <p>
            My research belongs to the interdisciplinary field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
            where I have a strong interest in understanding and studying how people experience and interact with AI
            in everyday life contexts. Within the HCI research community I have positioned myself as a
            theory-driven researcher working on Human-AI Interaction across various domains of application (e.g.,
            social
            robots, recommender systems, robot process automation, agentic AI, autonomous vehicles) with a special focus
            on the relationship between (interpersonal) trust and explanations.
            To extend my expertise and to
            pursue a habilitation in HCI
            at University of Salzburg, I am currently working towards a comprehensive and systematic analysis
            of mistrust and distrust in AI. Understanding and studying the so-called “dark side of
            trust” in the specific context of HAII is important for tackling the black-box problem of complex AI
            systems, and I wish to fill
            this research gap by investigating why people are unwilling to trust in AI.

            My research more
            generally
            covers the three major topics:

            <p>
                My research focuses on clarifying and advancing complex social and ethical concepts in human-AI
                interaction
                such as trust, agency,
                explainability, and vulnerability. I combine these theoretical perspectives
                with system development to ensure that concepts are not only clearly defined in theory but can
                also be meaningfully implemented in practice. By connecting conceptual work with challenges in
                science and
                engineering, I help create
                a stronger foundation for theory-driven human-AI interaction research and support the development of
                AI systems
                that are
                socially aware and ethically grounded.

            <p>
                I am particularly interested in developing and refining user research methods used to study human-AI
                interaction in online settings. I design and implement interactive experimental setups that
                make use of
                digital
                platforms to conduct research in ways that are scalable, diverse, and closer to
                real-world contexts. By
                expanding the methodological possibilities of online experimentation, I contribute to more robust,
                reproducible, ecologically valid, and innovative research practices. As such, my work enables
                deeper
                insights into
                user
                behavior and supports the development of AI systems that respond more effectively to social contexts and
                human
                needs or preferences.

            <p>
                I work across disciplinary boundaries to
                address
                foundamental questions in human-AI interaction and Computer Science more broadly. I am interested in how
                different disciplines and
                methodologies frame and
                define core problems in AI. By applying philosophical methods such as critical reflection and
                careful
                analysis of
                underlying assumptions, I question and constructively inform mainstream approaches to AI. My
                meta-level perspective allows me to
                also reflect on the epistemological foundations of philosophy. In doing so,
                I
                strengthen the methodological basis of interdiciplinary work and underscores the essential role of
                the humanities and social sciences in addressing complex and unresolved challenges in AI research.
