        <h1>Outreach</h1>
        <p>Text goes here.</p>
        <h3>Panel Member</h3>
        <p>
            I was part of the discussion panel for the PhD course "From Surviving to Thriving - Crafting your Good
            Professional Life" organized by Geraldine Fitzpatrick and Ambika Shahu (TU Wien). It was great to share my
            experiences of working in academia, and try to advice current TU Wien PhD students about what I find useful
            and challenging about the postdoctoral research phase.
        </p>
        <h3>Panel Discussion</h3>
        <p>
            I joined experts from research and business to talk about the use of artificial intelligence in robotics,
            the current status of robot development and the possible effects on our society. The "KI-Talk" series of
            events are part of the reorientation of the Deutsches Museum Bonn into a forum for artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <h3>Online Talk</h3>
        <p>
            I had the pleasure of presenting some work from my PhD project at one of the Talking Robotics seminars. It
            was a great discussion and I appreciate the good feedback I got from my presentation!
        </p>
        <h3>#5QW Interview</h3>
        <p>
            To promote the diversity of researchers at TU Wien Informatics, I was asked to participate in an interview
            to present my path into research and my current work. It was great to participate!
        </p>
        <h3>Pilot Project</h3>
        <p>
            As a WTZ Ost pilot project, in order to enhance knowledge transfer at the University of Vienna, I have spend
            some time during the spring 2017 working with artist and illustrator, Solmaz Farhang, on communicating my
            research on social robotics to non-experts. Below is the result of our work showing four different fictional
            ethnographic field observations taking place in the near future.

        <h3>Blog Posts</h3>
        <p>
            Every semester the University of Vienna is posing a question ("semesterfrage"), which they invite members of
            the faculty to reflect upon and discuss.

            For the winter semester of 2016 the questions was "how are we going to live in a digital future". I
            contributed to the discussion by writing a short blog post titled "When an Interface Becomes the Face". I
            had a lot of fun preparing this blog post not only because I could present some of my work and reflections
            on social robotics but also because I got the change to present it to the general public.

            For the summer semester 2017, I reflected on the topic "Gesundheir aus Dem Labor - Was ist Möglich?". I
            contributed with the blog post titled "Robot Supported Health" where I gave some examples of how robots are
            currently developed and used to improve the health of people and how the work in laboratories of robot
            engineers is going to play a significant role in the healthcare of tomorrow.

        <h3>Photo Competition</h3>
        <p>
            During the spring 2017 I participated in the photo competition named “My Research in one Picture” organized
            by the University of Vienna. The competition aimed to help early stage researchers communicate their
            research to a general audience and to become more visible.

            With my picture "Betwixt & Between" I tried to illustrate my work on social robotics from the perspective
            of sociology. After an initial selection process, my photo was selected by the committee to continue to the
            second round in which a facebook vote placed it among the top 10 favorites. Although my photo was exhibit
            during the prize ceremony for the other participants and committee to see, it did not rank among the top 3.
            However, it was a very good experience to present my work in a more visual format and I still believe that
            it captures the essence of much of my research back then.
