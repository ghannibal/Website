                <h3>Conceptual analysis, modelling, and engineering</h3> I am interested in understanding and advancing
                complex social and ethical notions (e.g., trust, agency, explainability, and vulnerability) in the
                context of human-AI and human-robot interaction. By integrating philosophical methods with system
                development and design, I aim to ensure that these concepts are not only theoretically well-defined but
                also practically implementable. This work advances the scientific foundations of interdisciplinary AI
                research by improving conceptual clarity, enabling empirical study of abstract constructs, and informing
                the development of socially aware and ethically grounded technologies.

                <h3>Online User Research Studies</h3> I have a particular interest in advancing user research methods,
                with a focus on designing and implementing novel experimental setups in online environments. I
                investigate how digital platforms can
                be used to study human interaction with AI systems in more scalable, diverse, and ecologically valid
                ways. By pushing the methodological boundaries of online experimentation, my work contributes to the
                development of robust, reproducible, and ethically sound approaches for empirical research in human-AI
                interaction. This enables more nuanced insights into user behavior, supports interdisciplinary
                theory-building, and informs the design of socially responsive AI technologies.

                <h3>Methodological Reflexivity and Metaphilosophical Perspectives</h3> I am interested in drawing on
                knowledge, methods, or perspectives
                from one or more disciplines to
                address a question or problem. I have a particular focus on how philosophical thinking and methods can
                meaningfully contribute to advancing human-AI and human-robot interaction. I investigate how conceptual
                analysis, ethical reasoning, and critical reflection---core to the humanities and social sciences---can
                help clarify and operationalize key notions such as trust, everyday life, and social agency in AI-driven
                systems. This work not only deepens the theoretical and ethical foundations of the field but also
                demonstrates the essential role of humanities perspectives in the responsible development of emerging
                technologies.
