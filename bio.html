        <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently an independent Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://exdigit.plus.ac.at/en/"
                target="_blank">EXDIGIT project</a> at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces,
            University of Salzburg.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was previously a
            Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of
            Artificial Intelligence at Ulm University (2022-2023) where I worked on combining my trust research
            with the topic of Explainable AI (XAI). While still a doctoral student, I served
            as an expert for the European Commission through my work in the <a
                href="https://ai-watch.ec.europa.eu/humaint_en" target="_blank">HUMAINT project</a>.
            Member of the TrustRobots Doctoral College (2018-2022) and the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
            group at TU Wien, I obtained my Doctorate in Computer
            Science (2022) where I focused on the topic of (interpersonal) trust in human-robot
            interaction. You are welcome to read and download my <a

                target="_blank">dissertation</a>, which I passed with distinction. I
            hold a BA and MA in Philosophy (2015) from
            Aarhus University where my thesis projects explored and presented the metaphysical dimensions
            of social
            robotics and also considered metaphilosophical perspectives.
            <br>
            <br>
            I contribute actively to the international and national HCI research
            community, taking on a range of professional
            responsibilities. Notably, I have served as an Associated Chair in the subcommittee on Critical Computing,
            Susaintability, and Social Justice (CCSSJ) at the CHI conference in 2025 and 2026. I am also the Vice Chair
            of the <a href="https://sigchiaustria.hosting.acm.org" target="_blank">Austrian ACM SIGCHI
                Chapter</a>, which is a national research network dedicated to strengthening and coordinating HCI
            research
            within
            Austria. Furthermore, I am growing into a leadership role by taking on supervision responsibilities and
            supporting
            junior researchers in their development. In addition, I regularly serve as program committee member,
            associate
            chair, and reviewer for
            major conferences and journals. Through these activities, I help
            maintain quality standards, support colleagues, and contribute to shaping discussions in human-AI
            interaction research.
            Alongside my academic service, I have been engaged in science communication and public
            outreach, motivated by my strong commitment to sharing research insights with the general public. My
            public-facing activities include, for example, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzpdRXZgMwk"
                target="_blank">online talk</a> in the Talking Robotics seminar series and
            participation in
            the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siyJp9TGEAw" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> held by the
            Deutsches
            Museum Bonn on the societal implications of AI and robots.
