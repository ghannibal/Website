        <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently an independent Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://exdigit.plus.ac.at/en/"
                target="_blank">EXDIGIT project</a> at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces,
            University of Salzburg.
            <br><br>
            I was previously a
            Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of
            Artificial Intelligence at Ulm University (2022-2023) where I worked on combining my trust research
            with the topic of Explainable AI (XAI).
            Part of the TrustRobots Doctoral College (2018-2022) and the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
            group at TU Wien, I obtained my Doctorate in Computer
            Science (2022) where I focused on the topic of Interpersonal Trust in Human-Robot
            Interaction. You are welcome to read and download my <a

                target="_blank">dissertation</a>, which I passed with distinction. I
            hold a BA and MA in Philosophy (2015) from
            Aarhus University where my thesis projects explored and presented the metaphysical dimensions
            of social
            robotics and also considered metaphilosophical perspectives.
            <br><br>
            I contribute actively to the international HCI research
            community, taking on a range of professional
            responsibilities. Notably, I am the Vice Chair of the <a href="https://sigchiaustria.hosting.acm.org"
                target="_blank">Austrian ACM SIGCHI
                Chapter</a>, which is a national research network dedicated to strengthening and coordinating HCI
            research
            within
            Austria. Furthermore, I am growing into a leadership role by taking on supervision responsibilities and
            supporting
            junior researchers in their development. In addition, I regularly serve as program committee member,
            associate
            chair, and reviewer for
            major conferences and journals. Through these activities, I help
            maintain quality standards, support colleagues, and contribute to shaping discussions in human-AI
            interaction research.
