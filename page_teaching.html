        <h1>TEACHING</h1>
        <p>My research-based teaching aims to teach students to combine theory and practice, take
            a multidisciplinary perspective, engage in critical thinking, and gain essential
            research skills. I have acquired my qualification through hands-on experience and participation in targeted
            training
            programs:
        <ul>
            <li>Lehrgang für Hochschuldidaktik (University of Salzburg, 2025).</li>
            <li>Basic Qualification for Junior Staff - Teaching in Higher Education (University of Vienna, 2016).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

                This lectures with exercises course explores the theory and methods of responsible HCI and to examine
                these ideas through real-world examples of designing and using computer-based technology. Responsible
                HCI rely
                on a variety of theory and methods to create technology that anticipates and
                reduces negative social, ethical, and environmental impacts. Students in this course will learn how to
                apply ethical frameworks, consider diverse perspectives, and reflect critically on technology design to
                ensure it aligns with broader social and ethical values.
