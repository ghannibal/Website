            To unlock the full potential of AI, people must be able to trust AI-powered systems.
            Yet trust in AI also involves risk and uncertainty as AI-powered systems are imperfect, which leave people
            vulnerable.
            For this reason, the key question is not simply whether people can or should trust AI, but how that trust is
            formed and managed.
            Examining the double-edged nature of trust in the specific context of human-AI interaction is an exciting
            area of research, as it also raises fundamental questions about what it means to be human.
