        <blockquote>
            To realize the full potential of AI, it is necessary that people trust in
            AI-powered systems. At the same time, trusting
            AI-
            powered systems entails risk and uncertainty because AI is imperfect, which leaves people vulnerable when
            trust
            is unwarranted or misplaced. For this reason, it is not only important to understand whether people can or
            should
            trust in AI-powered systems. Studying the double-edge nature of trust within the speci!c context of human-AI
            interaction (HAII) is ineradicably exciting research because it also brings fundamental questions about
            humanity
            to the forefront.
